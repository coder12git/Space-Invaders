## Inspiration ✨
The retro theme reminded us of 2 things. Our favorite childhood game Space Invaders and our favorite movie Star Wars. This inspired our project which is renovated Space Invaders in Star Wars theme with motion detection!

## What it does?👨‍💻
The user plays the role of a Jedi, defeating the aliens with his lightsaber! To modernize it, we decided to use motion controls instead of the classic keypad.
 
## How we built it ⚙️
### Python
 - we used opencv to detect and label the hands
 - the label generated was used to control the player object in the game made using pygame.
### Figma
 - we used figma to plan out a wireframe and to materialise the idea for the ui.
### Adobe-illustrator and photoshop
 - we used them to create the assets.

## Challenges we ran into 💻
- Working with motion detection for the first time!
-  Also, our first experience with game development!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
- Making sick graphics!!
- Modernizing a classic game!

## What we learnt 📚
Teamwork makes the dream work!

## What's next for Space Invaders?🔥
Trying out a bunch of motion detection technologies like eye and hand movement detection!!
